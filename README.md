# Haplogroup Story Teller

This project is aimed at creating a platform that tells the story of human migration and ancestry through Y haplogroups.

## Overview

Y Haplogroups are genetic population groups who share a common ancestor on the paternal line. By analyzing Y chromosome, we can trace the ancestry and migration patterns of human populations over the years.

This project aims to provide an display of such ancestry for a given set of haplogroups.

## Features

- **Dropdown of haplogroups**
- **A tree image with ancestry**

## To run
Use the Annotation excel file to run the basic.py scriot to filter the data.
Change the path in the interface.R script for aadr_data, tree and image with the data files provided, AADR_test, chrY_hGrpTree_isogg2016.tsv, image.png respectively

## Technologies Used

A python script was written to filter the AADR dataset for haplogroups, date (mean) and origins.
A R shiny script was written to run the application
